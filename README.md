# Mailroom
Mailroom is an application to manage mail service for hundreds of clients by securely storing client data and accurately tracking mailbox activity. Mailroom was developed for shelters or other non-profit organizations providing a mailing address for people who are unhoused or otherwise do not have access to a safe place to consistently receive mail
